# The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
# Further, this function does the following tasks
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of the inverse
# 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function(x)
  setinv <- function(solve) 
    m <<- solve
  getinv <- function() 
    m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache while displaying the message prompt to the user.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data for Matrix Inverse")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(m)
  m
}
